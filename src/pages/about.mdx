MAKE Roanoke is a non-profit organization dedicated to establishing a community
makerspace in Roanoke, VA.  MAKE Roanoke is run by volunteers.  We are currently
in the process of acquiring space to set up workshops for MAKE Roanoke members.

## Mission Statement

MAKE Roanoke exists to promote knowledge, skill, and creativity in science,
technology, crafts, and the arts. We strive to foster these values in an
inclusive and safe environment. To these ends, MAKE Roanoke shall provide the
following:

 * An inclusive and collegial social framework for members to inspire and
   collaborate with others of similar interests;
 * A maintained communal space providing safe access to tools and supplies for
   projects; and
 * Events to promote education and collaboration between members and the greater
   Roanoke community.
